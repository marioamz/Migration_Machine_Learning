\f0\fs24 \cf0 LAPOP Migration Project\
\
Goal: Use machine learning to determine which features best predict or correlate with a survey respondent indicating they want to migrate within the next three years\
\
Data: LAPOP survey data from 2012-2019 from three countries: Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, these countries are coded as 4, 3, 2 in LAPOP. \
\
read.py\
\
Uses pandas to read in data. It then selects the countries and years I care about, followed by removing any questions that had more than 5% nulls (as an argument for MAR). Lastly, it imputes missing values with zero, which is the non-response answer. \
\
explore.py\
\
Questions: \
	What is distribution of intent to migrate in all three countries across years?\
	\
\
Next steps: \
	- Begin data exploration, which includes correlation heat map\
\
Assumptions so far:\
	- Only keeping in variables (questions) answered in all three countries for all years\
	- Determined that MAR means that any given question was answered more than 95% of the time\
	- Nulls in this scenario are equal to zero, which is no response\
	- We don\'92t need to apply weights, since they\'92re useful only in the aggregate\
\
Things I know:\
	- q14 is the dependent variable, which is 1 for yes and 2 for no. It\'92s binary. \
	- Need to change no response codes that aren\'92t zero to actual zeroes,\
		- Do they change my 5% analysis?\
\
Questions to be determined\
	- What do I do with my nulls in dependent variable?\
	- Do I need to do MAR analysis per year? Currently doing for all years together\
	- What\'92s valuable data exploration here (per country, per year)?\
	- How do I do train-test splits given the different years and countries?\
	- Is this a time series analysis that will require LASSO or LSTM or others?\
	- How do I do a robustness check?\
		- Camila does OLS?\
		- Do other countries (Mexico, Nicaragua, Venezuela)?\
		- Do country/year pairs to expand independent variables?\
\
Big ideas\
	- Use selenium and beautiful soup to set up an automatic way to download any .dta file from LAPOP\
		- This avoids storing large .dta files in computer for long time,\
